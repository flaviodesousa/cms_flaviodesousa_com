flaviodesousa.com CMS
=====================

This is the [Mezzanine](http://mezzanine.jupo.org) implementation of my personal website [http://flaviodesousa.com](http://flaviodesousa.com).

If you are trying Mezzanine this could be used as a base setup since very few changes were made to the content itself.

I've changed (customized):

- Theme (using the [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com) [Slate](http://bootswatch.com/slate) theme)
- base.html, index.html, footer\_scripts.html, mezzanine.css

The [wiki](https://github.com/flaviodesousa/cms_flaviodesousa_com/wiki) tries to explain development and deployment.
